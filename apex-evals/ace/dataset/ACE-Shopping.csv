I believe that these last longer and are more comfortable than the newer boots that have synthetic uppers.

I do not drive; thus, I only want to buy from vendors that have a physical store in Irvine so that I can walk into their store and try on suitable boots.

Recipient persona: My husband recently started gig delivery work. Each route is different. Routes with houses are pretty easy, but the downtown huge apartment buildings are a nightmare. It's also hard to find parking, so sometimes he has to carry multiple packages and walk a long distance to the building because he doesn't want to get a ticket. The packages can be tiny or really big and heavy. He drives a compact sedan, and for some routes, the packages almost fill the entire car. He has a dolly, but it does not hold items from all four sides, so packages fall off easily.

I love vinyl and I love rock. The problem is: She pretty much has all of the rock records she wants. I'm talking about the Doors, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc. So all she's looking for are rare, hard to find, original psychedelic rock LP's from the sixties. The kind that were never in the Billboard Top 40 or even Top 100 and that really only collectors know about. The kind that sit high on the ""show off"" wall because they're so amazingly cool, rare, and expensive. The kind that my friend drools over.
