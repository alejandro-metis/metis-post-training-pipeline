7828,490,"Persona: I’m designing a game aimed at kids called “Dinosaur Tracks” that has a creative twist on a typical board game: players can use floor tiles to design their own custom game path throughout their home, with each player functioning as their own game piece that moves on the path (just like a character token moves around the board's path in the game Candy Land). The gameplay is relatively simple; it is turn-based with players each rolling their own dice and moving forward toward the “treasure” at the end of the board. Players have to follow various instructions on the floor tile they happen to land on, such as “lose a turn,” “go back to start” or “switch places with any character.”  The main issue I’ve run into is player visibility; because players can lay out the game board any way they’d like to, the path may move into another room, and players could get separated from each other.
