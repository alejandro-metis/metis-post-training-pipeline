You are evaluating a model-generated response
against a specific criterion. Your task is to
determine if the response satisfies this criterion and provide a concise explanation.

Criterion to evaluate: {criterion_description}

Response to evaluate: {solution}

Instructions:
1. First, analyze the response against the given criterion.
2. Determine if the response fully satisfies the criterion (result = 1) or not (result = 0).
3. Provide a concise explanation (maximum 2-3 sentences) that:
    a. States whether the criterion is met or not
    b. Points to specific evidence from the response
    c. Avoids unnecessary details or repetition

Return your evaluation in the following JSON format:
{{
    "result": <1 or 0>,
    "reason": "<concise explanation>"
}}

Keep your explanation brief and focus on the key points that justify your result.
